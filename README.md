# EGCFS

This is the code for the method EGCFS in this paper:

R. Zhang, Y. Zhang, and X. Li, “Unsupervised Feature Selection via Adaptive Graph Learning and Constraint,” IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems. 

The "Datasets EGGS" consists of the datasets used in the paper.
The performance of this method is a little sensitive to the parameters and you may need to adjust the parameters.
Besides that, you can normalize the original data matrix to get better experimental results in some datasets.
