# EGCFS

This is the code for the method EGCFS in this paper:

R. Zhang, Y. Zhang and X. Li, "Unsupervised Feature Selection via Adaptive Graph Learning and Constraint," in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, doi: 10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3042330.

The "Datasets EGGS" consists of the datasets used in the paper.
The performance of this method is a little sensitive to the parameters and you may need to adjust the parameters.
Besides that, you can normalize the original data matrix to get better experimental results in some datasets.
